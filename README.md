This course is part of a MIT Micromasters program: [Statistics and Data Science (General Track)](https://www.edx.org/masters/micromasters/mitx-statistics-and-data-science-general-track?index=product&queryID=73a3540be72ac4ceba750abb2930dce3&position=4&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete)

## Project description:
- **Project 0**: Setup, Numpy Exercises, Tutorial on Common Packages
- **Project 1**: Sentiment analysis, using bag of words feature engineering and linear classification algorithms: Perceptron, averaged Perceptron and Pegasus
- **Project 2**: MNIST Digit recognition, using a variaty of image feature mapping techniques (PCA, kernel functions (cubic, Gaussian RBF) ) and classification techniques (Linear regression using digit as targets, SVMs and Softmax Regression)
- **Project 3**: Manualy crafted Neural Network and MNIST Digit recognition using Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network
- **Project 4**: Collaborative filtering (matrix completion of Netflix movie ratings) using Gaussian Mixture Model for which the parameters are estimated with Expectation-Maximization algorithm (Missing movie ratings completed as a weighted sum of all cluster means for that movie. The weights are the probabilities for this user to belong to each cluster). K-means and GMM methods comparison.
- **Project 5**: Q-Learning algorithm implemented to a simple Reinforcement Learning game. State-action pairs vector encoding and Q-function estimation using Linear and DNN methods.
